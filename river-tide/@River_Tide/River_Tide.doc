predict tide in a backwater affected river with a sloping/varying bed

Assumptions and capabilities:
	- tidal dynamics follow the 1D-Shallow-Water-Equation
	  (depth and cross-sectionally averaged Navier-Stokes-Equation)
	- rectangular cross section
	- width can vary along the channel
	- friction coefficient (cd) constant along channel and over time (Chezy)
	- advective accelleration term is considered, but can be deactivated
	- vertical profile of streamwise velocity is constant
	  (Boussinesq coefficient is unity (1))

Limitations / TODO list:
	- single channel dynamics only (no tidal networks)
	- no wind-shear stress (no storm surges)
	- no tidal flats / intertidal areas (width constant in time)
	- no flood-plain during high-river flow
	- no stratification or along-channel salinty gradient
	- negligible head loss in channel bends
	- negligible feed-back of the sediment concentration on the propagation of the tide
	- low Froude Number (no hydraulic jumps due to cataracts or tidal bores)	

- At present, only two tidal components are supported
  (either D1 with D2 or D2 with D4, in addition to the mean water level z0),
  for mixed diurnal-semidiurnal cases with dominant semidiurnal component,
  the class has to be extended to support three components (D1, D2 and D4)

- At present, the tripel overtide is not computed (D3 for diurnal, D6 for semindiurnal tide),
  note that this is the main overtide for the case of low river flow

- At present, the 1/h non-linearity is only included in the approximations of
  the backwater curve, but not it's influence on the tidal frequency components

Method:

This class calls numerical solvers for second order ordinary differential
equation boundary value problems

Tides is represented as exponential series in form of total discharge Q = sum Q_i = Q_0 + Q_1 + Q_2,
as discharge is conserved (balanced), the equations are simpler than for level z and velocity u,
and the frequency components of z are straight forward determined by differentiation of Q
